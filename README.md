Quick and dirty shell scripts that install Linux software for developers. Get into your development workflow on a new machine with one command. Made for Ubuntu. 

```bash
./install/java.sh
```

Future plans: make a complete distribution out of this. Also have install scripts for hotkeys, GNOME, extensions, etc.

Option A:
1. Start with Ubuntu
2. GNOME
3. Bunch of install scripts
4. Hotkeys and stuff

Option B:
Instead of Ubuntu, make a build from http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/. Follow with steps 2-4.
